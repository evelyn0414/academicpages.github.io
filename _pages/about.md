Hi :) 

This is Yuwei Zhang (Evelyn). I'm currently a third-year student at the School of Computer Science at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). I have been a research assistant in the Mobile Systems and Networking (MSN) group since 2019, advised by Prof. [Yang Chen](https://chenyang03.wordpress.com/). 
I've been working on social network and mobile user behaviors analysis.
